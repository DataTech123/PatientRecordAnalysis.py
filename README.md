This healthcare data project connects SSMS to VS Code to use Python scripts and SQL queries to interact with data and extract patient transaction records from the previously designed patient record track database in SSMS.

In the VS Code window, the part 1 block of code connects to SSMS and shows a successful connection.
The part 2 block of code contains SQL statements for data reference and logical syntax development. 
Finally, the part 3 main script interacts to extract data sets from the database. In a real-world project based on departmental software requirement, I am capable to use other libraries, including NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQLAlchemy, and T-test for health data analysis.

Thank you for your review of the fundamental framework for this SQL and Python script project from a self-designed database. As always, I look forward to refining any codes for further development .
